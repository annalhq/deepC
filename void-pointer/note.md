# void Pointers

We know that that a pointer contains just an address to something in memory.
So the pointer itself is unsigned integer.

In `int *a` pointer `a` is not datatype integer but instead it means it is pointing to a datatype `int`

Recap pointers here:
1. [Blinkey pointer fun video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VnDaHBi8dM)
2. [Pointers in c++ by cherno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxHyVn0ODg)
So the type that we associate with a pointer is only used when it's dereferenced.
